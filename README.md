**jqsh** is a shell based on [jq](http://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

This was the original rough draft, with a very basic [repl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop). To run it, place the package in your `sys.path`, then run `python3 -m jqsh`. To exit the loop, press control-D.

Development on this Python implementation has ended. For the active Rust implementation, see [jqsh](https://github.com/jq-shell/jqsh).
